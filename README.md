Why This Project? 🤔

Picture this: You’re a business analyst and the CEO just asked, "How are we doing with sales? And what’s the financial outlook?" You need answers, fast! That’s where Sales Performance and Profit & Loss (P&L) Reports come in, and we’ve got you covered.

With this project, we’ve not only built reports to answer those crucial questions, but we’ve also designed them in a way that’s easy to follow and even easier to present. 💡

What’s in the Box? 🎁

Sales Performance Report 📈

Customer Performance Analysis: We’ve dug into the data to analyze how well customers are performing. Who’s buying? Who's not? You’ll know exactly where your business stands. 😎

Market Performance vs Sales Targets: Here comes the fun part — comparing how well the market is doing vs your targets. Are we crushing our goals, or is there room for improvement? 🏆

Finance Report 💸

Profit and Loss (P&L) by Fiscal Year & Months: We’ve crafted clean and detailed P&L reports that make understanding finances feel like a walk in the park. 📊

P&L by Markets: Every market has its own story to tell. We’ve created reports that break it down region by region, helping you spot trends and make informed decisions.

Tools & Magic Used 🪄✨

Power Query: We used this tool to transform data and clean it up like a pro. Messy data? Not a problem! 🧹

Power Pivot: This helped us build complex data models to create relationships and structure the data for easy analysis. 🔗

DAX: Calculated columns and measures, anyone? Yes, please! DAX made sure we had all the custom calculations we needed to analyze the data deeply. 📏

Pivot Tables: Let’s get real – pivot tables are magic. They let us analyze big data in seconds, summarizing and presenting it clearly. ⚡

Project Flow 🚀

Customer Performance Report:
We started by analyzing the sales data — Who are our top customers? What products are flying off the shelves? This report will help answer all these questions and more. 🔍

Market Performance vs Sales Targets:
Once we understood how our customers were doing, we compared that against market performance and sales targets. Are we ahead or behind? Let’s find out! 🔥

Profit and Loss Reports:
Then came the financial breakdowns. We analyzed Profit & Loss by fiscal year and months, and also dived into the data by individual markets. Think of this like a financial health check for the company. 💰

The Data-Driven Journey 🌍
This project isn’t just about creating reports — it’s about bringing data to life. We’ve designed these reports to not only look good but also speak to the person reading them. Whether you’re looking at sales trends or financial health, these reports will provide the clarity you need to take action.
